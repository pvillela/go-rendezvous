// Package rdv supports the safe and convenient execution of asynchronous computations with
// goroutines and provides facilities for the safe retrieval of the computation results.
// It provides safety in the sense that panics in asynchronous computations are transformed
// into error results and its methods and functions prevent resource leaks, race conditions,
// and deadlocks for the channels used to pass data between the parent and child goroutines.
